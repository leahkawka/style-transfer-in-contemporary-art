## üóûÔ∏è Abstract

_Style transfer_ is a transformative technique in computer vision that merges artistic styles with digital image content, bridging the gap between art, culture, and technology. This report provides a comprehensive examination of style transfer, starting with its conceptual foundations and historical intersections with art.

It defines key style features and explores the evolution of techniques, from early neural style transfer to more advanced GAN-based and diffusion-based approaches. Further, the study investigates applications of style transfer across various domains, including open-source model platforms, browser-based applications, and commercial implementations.

It also examines the societal impact and ethical challenges associated with this technology. A particular focus is given to visual artifacts as stylistic elements in _contemporary art_, analyzing their role in cultural reinterpretation and their influence on identifying a new style in artworks.

Finally, the report discusses future directions, highlighting emerging trends in style transfer research, and the broader implications of computer vision-driven artistic generation. The conclusions underline the increasing relevance of style transfer as a tool for creative expression and cultural preservation.
